# CS112-Final-Project

This is the final project from my decision - based class.

The paper replicates figure 1 from a research by David K. Humphreys and Douglas . Figure one
shows the monthly rates of homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida and other chosen
comparison states of New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia. A synthetic experiment was
conducted that consisted of Florida and the States above. These States currently have no policies
regarding the use of Firearms for self- Defence. As a result, they form a control group consisting
of a weighted combination to form an Imagined State “Synthetic Florida”. (The least weight is
Massachussets with 0.1 and Ohio with about 20%).
